I made a website to see and add artists just to create a resource to access that would give you a quick glimpse of someone you may of not had exposure to. 
I want to add more sections and get more fimiliar with css and Active Record associations by playing with this until I feel like I have a real website. 
I seeded it instead of using an API just to make it more of exactly what I wanted it to be.
